# Python_scripts_vanderValketal2025

This folder provides the scripts used for analysing data and creating the figures used in van der Valk et al. (2025a and 2025b). The files contain the following information:

- Cnn_CML_paper_24_2.ipynb: This is the jupyter notebook used to do the analysis and create the figures of _**van der Valk et al. (2025a):**_ **_Use of commercial microwave links as scintillometers: potential and limitations towards evaporation estimation_**.
- Evaporation_CML_paper_4_3.ipynb: This is the jupyter notebook used to do the analysis and create the figures of _**van der Valk et al. (2025b):**_ _**Evaporation measurements using commercial microwave links as scintillometers**_.
- Cnn_to_fluxes.py: This .py contains functions for conversion between turbulent heat fluxes and Cnn
- EC_structure_parameter.py: This .py contains functions to compute structure parameters from 10 Hz EC data.
- Spectrum.py: This .py file contains functions to compute and smooth power spectra.
- theoretical_spectrum_24_2.py: This .py file contains functions to compute theoretical spectra and retained amount of variance.
- Convert_signal.py: This .py file contains some functions used for conversion of dB to mW etc. (Also contains functions for rainfall retrieval)
